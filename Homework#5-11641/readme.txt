Thank you for reviewing my code.

Here are some information and tips about my project.

(a)The files in the folder Training_Set are all the training files you gave me.I need to read them in my code.

(b)The folder query includes the files of small query set and large query set.In order to reduce running time, I set the small query set in the code. But I also did experiments on the large set. You may change the target set as you wish in the code. 

(c)I will display time for 4 algorithms in stdout. The rating result of four algorithms will store in respectively 
         (1) /query/result_user_mean.txt 
	 (2) /query/result_movie_mean.txt 
	 (3)/query/result_user_norm.txt
	 (4) /query/result_user_custom.txt

Again, thank you for your patience.If there is problem in running code,please contact me.I am pretty sure my code works fine.
